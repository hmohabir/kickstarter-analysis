# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

To find out how Louise's various campaigns fared based on when they were launched and their goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

Outcomes were filiered against launch date (in months). This allowed us to see which months had the most successful launchs and which one had the most failed ones.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The month of Febuary was most successful month to launch a Theater
January, on the other hand, had the most failed launches.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In the category of Plays, The most successful launches were those with a goal of less than $1000, followed by $1000 - $4999. 
The highest failures were those with goals $45000 and above.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The "Outcomes based on Goals only looked at the sub-category of Plays. I feel that more conclusive data could have been obtained if all categories were included to see the bigger picture. I understand that more data would need to be filtered to provide a bigger picture.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
 
Most theater are successful in the first three months of the year, as well as November. 
December has the least success as well as failures, hence, it is not a good month to launch a theater.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Goals of less than $10000 fare better than those that were higher than $10000, Also, the failure rate of Plays abpve goals of $44000 carried a high failure rate.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Other tables and graphs that could be created inclucde:
Which category is the most successful.
Which goals are not worth going after.
Break even points on graphs to show which plays fare better at what month of the year.
